This is a quick and small web app that I built for a coding test. 

The only external dependency is boodtrap 4 which is included in package.json file

To run the app in your computer:
    1. Clone this repo to your local machine;
        eg: run command ->  npm clone https://github.com/sanjay-gurung/Weather-Check.git
    2. After download is complete, open your code editor and run the command to install dependencies ->  npm i 
    3. After package installation is complete, run the project using command ->  ng serve
    4. for running test, run the command ng test
